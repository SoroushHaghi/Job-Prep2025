Day 1: Bridged from Pandas to NumPy for signal processing. Practiced array creation, vectorization, & slicing. Simulated a noisy sine wave, then filtered it using SciPy & visualized the results with Matplotlib. Project managed with Git.


Day 2:We set up a professional Python project with src and tests folders. After debugging complex configuration issues, we wrote our first passing unit test using pytest, created a virtual environment, and successfully pushed the entire structure to GitHub.


Day 3: Automating with GitLab CI/CD.We'll build a pipeline to automatically lint the code and run all unit tests on every push. This guarantees code quality and stability, professionalizing our development workflow and catching errors early.


Day 4/5:Built a 2-stage GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate code quality checks. Stage 1 uses flake8 for linting, and Stage 2 uses pytest for unit testing. Proved its value by catching an intentional bug, demonstrating a working automated safety net.
