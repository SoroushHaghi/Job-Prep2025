Day 1: Bridged from Pandas to NumPy for signal processing. Practiced array creation, vectorization, & slicing. Simulated a noisy sine wave, then filtered it using SciPy & visualized the results with Matplotlib. Project managed with Git.


Day 2:We set up a professional Python project with src and tests folders. After debugging complex configuration issues, we wrote our first passing unit test using pytest, created a virtual environment, and successfully pushed the entire structure to GitHub.


- Testing the GitLab to GitHub push mirroring setup.
